> Community Advice Offices are “independent non-profit organisations that offer free legal services and human rights information, advice and services to people who are marginalised through poverty, social circumstances and geographical location” – [The National Alliance for the Development of Community Advice Offices (NADCAO)](http://nadcao.org.za/)

The Foundation for Human Rights (FHR) has been facilitating access to justice imperatives since 1996 through its flagship programme to Community-Based Advice Offices (CAOs), which have played a crucial role in delivering justice services to indigent communities from the time of apartheid to the present day. 

Throughout the various stages of South Africa’s development, CAOs have served on the frontlines, ensuring access to rights and protection for communities most affected by social injustice. CAOs are typically staffed by community-based paralegals and local advice practitioners, who provide first-tier support to individuals from under-resourced communities that do not have the means to access any other form of legal advice or representation. During the apartheid era, CAOs arose organically to protect victims of state repression, both at the hands of security forces and legal institutions, which systematically excluded and persecuted black South Africans. Dating back to the establishment of the very first office providing paralegal service in 1937, the CAO sector has responded and provided respite to individuals who were illegally detained, forcefully removed or whose labour was (and still is) exploited. 

Though the work of CAOs has shifted dramatically with the advent of democracy, the client demographic remains the same – poor, black and vulnerable communities. Two key characteristics unique to CAOs are their rootedness in the communities they serve, and the provision of services that are free-of-charge. Contemporary CAOs offer a diverse range of skills, including the provision of basic legal advice; referrals to public-interest litigating NGOs, Chapter 9 institutions and government departments; Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR); human rights education; and family or community mediation. CAOs operate in a crucial space, which straddles the complexities of the dualistic formal legal system and traditional law. For example, drawing on methods such as ADR, CAOs are able to resolve cases at the community level, helping to relieve pressure on the formal courts, which are already experiencing an excess in demand. The CAO model is not exclusive to South Africa. Instruments such as the Lilongwe Declaration and the Kampala Declaration demonstrate the Pan-African scope of the paralegal movement. 

Some of the most coveted services requested by beneficiaries, include assistance with securing documents, such as ID books and birth certificates, applications for social grants, Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) case support, and addressing illegal evictions and transfer of house deeds. These services respond to the overwhelming deficit of socioeconomic opportunities within historically disadvantaged regions, where many people continue to be victims of labour exploitation and are disproportionately surviving on social grants. Another key domain of CAOs relates to concerns surrounding family law, such as domestic abuse, family disputes and divorce. Other service areas that CAOs respond to include xenophobia and migrant rights, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS-related concerns, sexual violence, and restorative justice with former inmates. 

In 2005, after the dissolution of the first united voice of paralegals, which had emerged in 1996 under the National Community-Based Paralegal Association (NCBPA), the sector and stakeholders established a new facilitative body, the National Alliance for the Development of Community Advice Offices (NADCAO). Its aim was to drive the sustainability goals of the sector. Over the past decade NADCAO has provided a lobby platform for the recognition of the paralegal profession as well as a space to develop professional standards and resource mobilisation. In November 2013, the culmination of NADCAO's six-year strategic plan overlapped with the much-anticipated launch of the representative body of advice offices, the Association of Community Advice Offices South Africa (ACAOSA). As the official elected and representative body of CAOs, ACAOSA has adopted its own governing Constitution and established a self-regulating body of standards and ethics with a punitive arm to respond to malpractice complaints.

Despite the recent achievements of NADCAO and sector allies, most CAOs continue to operate under precarious financial circumstances. Securing a stable source of funding for the sector, which will enable the implementation of a long-term access to justice strategy, is the most critical challenge to the sector at present.  As a result of the burden that comes with not having reliable funding, CAOs across the country are in a constant state of flux with offices opening up where there is demand and closing down where resources are limited. This directory aims to assist beneficiaries, by providing them with an up-to-date portal through which they can search for much needed CAO services in their community. In addition, the directory is a live record of all of the operational CAOs across the country.
